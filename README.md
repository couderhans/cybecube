WHAT IS A CYBECUBE?
===================

CYBECUBE is the abbreviation of cybernetic cube. cybe-cube...
With cybernitec as the transdisciplinary approach for regulatory systems, their constraints and possibilities.
see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics
The cybe-cube mentioned in this GitHub repository, is a virtual reality platform intended for didactic purposes.

Lot's of children, when they are following a STEM course (Science Technology Engineering & Mechanics) have learning difficulties, due to the abstract nature
of the courses and due to the mathematical knowledge requiered.  The CYBECUBE VR Platrom tries to find solutions by increasing mathematical knowledge and making some
subjects less abstract.  
It does that by visualising the abstract concepts in a virtual reality environment.
